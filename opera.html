            (Marco and Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
            cleaning the crown and the sceptre. The Gondoliers are discovered,
            enjoying themselves without reference to social distinctions.)
        </em></p>

    <p><strong>MARCO:</strong>
        Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction
        and good feeling.

        That's all right.
    </p>

        At the same time there is just one little grievance that we should like to ventilate.
    </p>

    <p><strong>ALL:</strong>
        What?
